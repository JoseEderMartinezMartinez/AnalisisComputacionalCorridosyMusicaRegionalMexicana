If there's a party
Glad to be in
If there's is a party
Glad to be in
If there is a party
Well, glad to be in
You said you'll bring the wine
O I love to drink
Maybe it's a joke
But no a fake
I met the presidential
And she told me
To bring you the snake
To bring you the snake
If there is a party
Well, glad to be in
You said you'll bring the wine
Oh I love to drink
To bring you the snake
To bring you the snake
To bring you the snake
Maybe it's a joke
But not a fake
To bring you the snake
To bring you the snake
Snake, snake, snake ah
Snake Ah! Snake Ah!
To bring you the snake
Snake, snake, snake ah
Snake Ah! Snake Ah!
Snake Ah! Snake Ah!
Snake Ah! Snake Ah!
