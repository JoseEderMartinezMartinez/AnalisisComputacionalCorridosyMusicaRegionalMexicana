The moon is burning in the sky
And I am burning with love
The fire that is consumed
Like my heart
My soul crys
Painfully
I'm not at peace
What a terrible night
The time passes
But there is no dawn
There is no sunshine
If she doesn't return
My earth is burning
And my heart is burning
What she thirsts for water
I thirst for love
Who will I sing
My song to
If there is no one
Who shows herself
On the balcony
The moon is burning in the sky
And I am burning with love
The fire that is consumed
Like my heart
