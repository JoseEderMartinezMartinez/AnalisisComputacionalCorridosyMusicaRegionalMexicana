Gotta flex a lot
I was broke as hell walkin' 'round passin' CDs in the parking lot
Now my lil' bitch want five racks for a new bag, is you rich or not? (Rich or not)
Pussy good, had to pay for it, let me knock it out like the Juggernaut (Juggernaut, yeah)
Let me stop (hold on)
Flexin' (flexin')
Wake up and brush my teeth, got on a flooded Cuban necklace (Ice)
I was broke, couldn't buy no Waffle House, my pockets pregnant (pregnant)
Hold on (hold on), let me count it, give me a second (beep)
Rich as hell
Bad bitches, gotta duck 'em all, I done fucked 'em all, I can't kiss and tell (yeah)
Baby mama steady trippin' on me, why she hatin' on me? Tell her go to hell (go to hell)
Young nigga, I done ran it up, money too tall, I can't go to jail (yeah)
Yeah, it was just me and Durel, yeah
I had to grind for real
Had to ride the train before I seen a mil' (mil')
Wake up, I put on new Chanel (yeah)
Left the house, couldn't leave my scale (uhh)
Left wrist like a hundred and twelve
Mama mad, couldn't take the smell (mama)
Too many racks, left a paper trail
Fuck 12, I would never tell (fuck 'em)
No deposit
Ran me a check up, I bought a masi' (skrrt)
Start me a label, not yo gotti (yo gotti)
I knock it out, she call me big papi (big papi)
Flexin'
So many diamonds, can't forget my bank account was on e (woo, woo)
Look at my cuban links, got me walkin' 'round with your bank account on me (rich)

Todos andan en el bar, colgándole el AK
Esos culitos hacen clap, rolando en un zig-zag
Muchas pacas, menos mal, ya saben que ando high
No es el Phantom, Cullinan, voy tapado y no es Irak
El navesón Aventador, una mansión como Playboy
Lo que una noche de morro soñó
Algunas dicen que soy un fuckboy
Fuck, no, no, no
Ya no sé ni cuántas son, las pastillas que me dio
Esta niña en el trocón me la llevo y qué sé yo
Lista pa' sacar la Glock
