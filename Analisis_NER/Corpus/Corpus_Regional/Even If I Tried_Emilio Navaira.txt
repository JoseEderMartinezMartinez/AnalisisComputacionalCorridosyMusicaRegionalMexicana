A pretty girl a desert island
If we were shipwrecked and she were smiling
What would I do, would I still be true to you
A million bucks a big ol' mansion
A millionaire said I could have 'em
If I would give you up, well honey he'd be out of luck
'Cause even if I tried even if I wanted to
Even if my life depended on telling you
Goodbye I couldn't say the word
'Cause you're mine and honey I'm forever yours
I couldn't get the knot untied even if I tried
You've got a smile it's captivating
And loving you there's no escaping
And when they're holding me, I'm right where I'm supposed to be
Dynamite and wild horses
All of mother nature's forces
Honey bring 'em on the hold you've got on me is twice as strong
'Cause even if I tried even if I wanted to
Even if my life depended on telling you
Goodbye I couldn't say the word
'Cause you're mine and honey I'm forever yours
I couldn't get the knot untied even if I tried
