He's not a cowboy really
He's not a city foke
And I know it might sound silly
If you ever heard and talked
But he's proud of being whom is
Perhaps the other kind
But he sings and dances
Country songs
'Cause he's a country man
Ranchero
They were hanging boots
And typical sombrero
Ranchero
He's not from here
But he's a country man
Nació en un jacalito
Allá en su localidad
Peró emigró pa'l norte, sí
Por la necesidad
Es facil verle por ahí
Tratando ser feliz
Llevando en su corazón
Su raza y su pais
Ranchero
They were hanging boots
And typical sombrero
Ranchero
He's not from here
But he's a country man
Ranchero
He's not from here
But he's a country man
