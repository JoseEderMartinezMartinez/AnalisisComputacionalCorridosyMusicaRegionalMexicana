Speak softly, love, and hold me warm against your heart;
I hear your words, the tender, trembling moments start.
We're in a world, our very own.
Sharing a love that only few have ever known.
(Chorus)
Wine colored days...warmed by the sun,
Deep, velvet nights...when we are one.
Speak softly, love, so no one hears us but the sky.
The vows of love we make will live until we die.
My life is yours,and all because
You came into my world with love, so softly love.
(Chorus)
Wine colored days...warmed by the sun,
Deep, velvet nights...when we are one.
Speak softly, love, so no one hears us but the sky.
The vows of love we make will live until we die.
My life is yours,and all because
You came into my world with love, so softly love.
