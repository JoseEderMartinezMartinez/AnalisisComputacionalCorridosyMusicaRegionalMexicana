Oye, you know the drama?
It goes something like this
It must be the ass that got me like damn
If they get any fatter, man, the rule going to have to get at her
And our situation won't matter
I come to make you smile in the freakiest manners
J to the l-o, hello
No, I'm not lee harvey oswald
I'm the rule and I shot call
Off the wall like mj in his early days
It's the inc. And lopez now
Ain't that funny?
It's been a while since you came around
Now you want to see what's going down
Tryna tell me why you want my time
Tryna tell me how I'm on your mind
See, it never had to be this way
You should have never played the games you played
Now I'm seeing that you're kind of lame
Knowing how the situation change
Ain't that funny? (ain't that funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny? (ain't that funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?
I remember how you walked away
Even when I tried to call your name
See at first I didn't understand
Now you're looking like a lonely man
I remember how you did me wrong
And now you're hurting 'cause my love is gone
Everybody gets a chance to burn
You can take it as a lesson learned
Ain't that funny? (ain't that funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny? (ain't that funny?)
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?
You gotta be straight and real, my friends
Our relationship is all about love, carrying, support and respect
You should never have to put out with any kind of abuse
Verbal, emotional or physical
And this goes to the guys to
Stand up for yourselfs
I know there's a gentleman out there
And they know how to treat a lady with respect
You check it out
The gentlemans said that a lady that knows how to act like a lady
And goes both ways my friends, if you want respect, you gotta have to give respect
And gotta have to have respect for yourself
Baby, I got my boyfriends
You got your girlfriends
Maybe we can be friends
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Baby, I've got my girlfriends
You got your biyfriends
But maybe we can be friends
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
