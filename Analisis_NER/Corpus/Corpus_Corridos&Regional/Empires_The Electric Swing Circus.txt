Can you hear the call?
Do you recall your papa, when he sat you on his knee
Telling you the stories of everything he's seen
Parading other people, how they braved the battlefield
Taking on an empire, fighting to be free
Oh papa, tell me what you saw
Tan-tan-tara, can you hear the call?
Oh papa, I can see it in your eye
Tan-tan-tara, ba-bap-da-da
Flying out the funnel, crackling on the radio
Emergency connections on a telephone exchange
You've reached the operator, what's the reason for your call?
Can you tell me what's the point in building empty empires, now?
Oh papa, tell me what you saw
Tan-tan-tara, can you hear the call?
Oh papa, I can see it in your eye
Tan-tan-tara, ba-bap-da-da
Oh, now they know that a hundred years ago
That they would build an empire strong
Give it time, and these imaginary lines will fade away
The battle goes around until we find a common ground
What's the point in building empty empires, now?
Oh papa, tell me what you saw
Tan-tan-tara, can you hear the call?
Oh papa, I can see it in your eye
Tan-tan-tara, ba-bap-da-da
Oh papa, tell me what you saw
Tan-tan-tara, can you hear the call?
Oh papa, I can see it in your eye
Tan-tan-tara, ba-bap-da-da
Oh, now they know that a hundred years ago
That they would build an empire strong
Give it time, and these imaginary lines will fade away
What's the point in building
What's the point in building
What's the point in building empty empires, now?
